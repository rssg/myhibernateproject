Q: How do I know which areas of change are more important?
A: That is partly a matter of experience in designing OO systems and also a matter of the knowing the domain you are working in. 
Looking at other examples will help you learn to identify areas of change in your own designs.

All design patterns provide a way to let some part of a system vary independently of other parts.

Take the part that varies and "encapsulate" it so it won't affect rest of the code

Programming to interface actually means - programming to supertype. Don't confuse it with java keyword 'interface'.
